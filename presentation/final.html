<h3>Mini-Turbo GF-responses to a strong-1<span class="gt">&clubs;</span> opening<a id="bg" /></h3>
Presented here is a new scheme for gameforcing (GF) responses to a strong-1<span class="gt">&clubs;</span> opening (16+).
<p>
<h4>Background<a id="bg" /></h4>
In Precision Club, 1<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>-1M is a natural GF with 5+major, while 1<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>-1NT is a balanced GF. 
<p>
The immediate and obvious downside of this natural scheme is that the final game/slam-contract very often gets "wrong-sided", i.e. declared by the weaker hand.
<p>
Later approaches to remedy this weakness has been, for example in Carrot-Club, to define 1<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>-1<span class="rt">&hearts;</span> as GF without 5+major, while 1<span class="bt">&spades;</span> shows 5<span class="rt">&hearts;</span>s and 1NT shows 5<span class="bt">&spades;</span>s
(another possibility is: 1<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>-1<span class="rt">&hearts;</span>=5<span class="bt">&spades;</span>, 1<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>-1<span class="bt">&spades;</span>=bal, 1<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>-1NT=5<span class="rt">&hearts;</span>).
<p>
This is an improvement, since it will wrong-side the final contract less often.
But after 1<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>-1<span class="rt">&hearts;</span>, for example, it is not unlikely that the final contract will still turn out to be hearts, particularly since responder may well have 4<span class="rt">&hearts;</span>s.
And after 1<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>-1NT, unless opener has spade support, the final contract is often a wrong-sided 3NT.
<p>
So can we do better than that?
<p>
<h4>Introduction<a id="intro" /></h4>
<p>
Last summer, at the annual Ã–rebro Bridge Festival in Sweden, I met with an old friend and bridge-partner from the 1980's, math professor Bengt Alrud from Gothenburg, Sweden, and got an introduction to his latest bidding-system, named "Turbo".
<p>
One of the features I really like, is the GF-responses to a strong-1<span class="gt">&clubs;</span> opening, particularly designed to minimize the risk of wrong-siding the contract.
<p>
The full system is very innovative and, frankly, amazing. But with a lot of complex relay-sequences hard to memorize. Therefore, I made a simplified version ("Mini-Turbo"), that I have played with a couple of other partners, and which resulted in the scheme presented here.
<p>
Besides placing the 1<span class="gt">&clubs;</span> opener as declarer, the aim is also -- through relay-methods -- that declarer should disclose as little information of his hand as possible to defenders.
<p>
While we can, of course, never completely guarantee right-siding of the final contract, I think you will agree that this approach increases the probability significantly.
<p>
Re. the relay-sequences, I am here employing a simple -- yet, very playable -- version, in order not to overshadow the basic concepts with complexities for now.
They can later be elaborated and enhanced, if so desired, as players gain experience and get more familiar with these methods.
<p>
<h4>System<a id="system" /></h4>
<p>
We open a strong-1<span class="gt">&clubs;</span> on all hands with 16+hcp, and a GF-responder is ca 9+hcp or a good 8 hcp.
A sound principle for subsequent slam-bidding is also that a GF-response promises minimum 2 controls (c) -- where Ace=2c, King=1c -- otherwise start 1<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>-1<span class="ot">&diams;</span>.
<p>
If you prefer 1<span class="gt">&clubs;</span> as 17+, you can of course adjust the hcp-ranges of responses below.
<p>
Generally, a GF-responder will show, in turn:
<p>
<span class="gt">&nbsp;</span> a) His relevant lengths in the majors, so opener can assess whether we have a common major trump-suit or not.
<p>
<span class="gt">&nbsp;</span> b) Whether he is <b>minimum (ca 8-11 bad hcp)</b> or has <b>extras (11 good hcp and up)</b>. When responder shows a minimum hand, opener can often set the game-contract immediately, to avoid spilling more information to defenders.
<p>
<span class="gt">&nbsp;</span> c) Only if opener still needs to know: More details about lengths/shortnesses in other suits, etc.
<p>
Here's the first round responses:
<pre>
<span class="gt">&nbsp;</span>1<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>-1<span class="ot">&diams;</span>  = 0-7(8) hcp, or less than 2c.

<span class="gt">&nbsp;</span>1<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>-1<span class="rt">&hearts;</span>  = GF. Denies 4<span class="rt">&hearts;</span>s. May or may not have <span class="bt">&spades;</span>-suit, i.e 0-5<span class="bt">&spades;</span>s. Covers both balanced and unbalanced hands.

<span class="gt">&nbsp;</span>1<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>-1<span class="bt">&spades;</span>  = GF. 4-5<span class="rt">&hearts;</span>s. Denies 4<span class="bt">&spades;</span>s. Covers both balanced and unbalanced hands, and may have a longer minor side-suit.

<span class="gt">&nbsp;</span>1<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>-1NT = GF. A 6-card major. Denies 4 in the other major.

<span class="gt">&nbsp;</span>1<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>-2<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>  = GF. At least 4-4 in the majors, but no 6-card major -- i.e 4-4/4-5/5-4/5-5 in majors.

<span class="gt">&nbsp;</span>1<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>-2<span class="ot">&diams;</span>  = Weak, ca 0-4 hcp. 6+<span class="rt">&hearts;</span>s.

<span class="gt">&nbsp;</span>1<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>-2<span class="rt">&hearts;</span>  = Weak, ca 0-4 hcp. 6+<span class="bt">&spades;</span>s.

<span class="gt">&nbsp;</span>1<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>-2<span class="bt">&spades;</span>  = GF. At least 5-5 in minors.

<span class="gt">&nbsp;</span>1<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>-2NT = GF. 6-4 or 4-6 in the majors.

<span class="gt">&nbsp;</span>1<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>-3X  = GF transfers, with 7+cards in the next higher suit (1<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>-3<span class="bt">&spades;</span> shows 7+<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>s).
</pre>
I will not cover the 1<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>-1<span class="ot">&diams;</span> continuations, any strong-1<span class="gt">&clubs;</span> scheme where 1<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>-1<span class="ot">&diams;</span> is negative 0+hcp will work.
<p>
<h4>The 1<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>-1<span class="rt">&hearts;</span> response<a id="1c1h" /></h4>
This is the most frequent positive response.
Responder denies 4<span class="rt">&hearts;</span>s, and could have anything from 0 to 5 <span class="bt">&spades;</span>s.
<p>
Opener now has 2 relays:<br />
<span class="gt">&nbsp;</span>1<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>-1<span class="rt">&hearts;</span>-1NT denying 4<span class="bt">&spades;</span>s, while<br />
<span class="gt">&nbsp;</span>1<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>-1<span class="rt">&hearts;</span>-1<span class="bt">&spades;</span><span class="gt">&nbsp;</span><span class="gt">&nbsp;</span><span class="gt">&nbsp;</span>shows 4+<span class="bt">&spades;</span>s.<br />
Both relays can be either balanced or unbalanced -- only the spade-length matters -- and with 4+<span class="bt">&spades;</span>s opener may also have another longer suit.
<p>
<h4>The 1<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>-1<span class="rt">&hearts;</span>-1<span class="bt">&spades;</span> relay<a id="1c1h1s" /></h4>
After 1<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>-1<span class="rt">&hearts;</span>-1<span class="bt">&spades;</span> (in line with the principles above) responder's priorities is to tell:
<p>
<span class="gt">&nbsp;</span>a) Whether he has 4+<span class="bt">&spades;</span> support, exactly 3<span class="bt">&spades;</span>s, or shorter <span class="bt">&spades;</span>-suit. 
<p>
<span class="gt">&nbsp;</span>b) Whether he has minimum or extra values.
<p>
<span class="gt">&nbsp;</span>c) (If needed) Whether he has a 5-card (or 6-card) minor.
<p>
The responses:
<pre>
<span class="gt">&nbsp;</span>1<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>-1<span class="rt">&hearts;</span>-1<span class="bt">&spades;</span>-1NT<span class="gt"> </span>= 4+<span class="bt">&spades;</span>s (sets <span class="bt">&spades;</span>s as trumps).
<span class="gt">&nbsp;</span><span class="gt"> </span><span class="gt"> </span><span class="gt"> </span>     -2<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>  = Exactly 3<span class="bt">&spades;</span>s.
<span class="gt">&nbsp;</span><span class="txt">Higher bids all show 2 or fewer <span class="bt">&spades;</span>s:</span>
<span class="gt">&nbsp;</span>1<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>-1<span class="rt">&hearts;</span>-1<span class="bt">&spades;</span>-2<span class="ot">&diams;</span>  = Minimum hand, ca 8-11 bad hcp.
<span class="gt">&nbsp;</span> <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>-2<span class="rt">&hearts;</span>  = Extras (ca 11 good hcp and up). Denies 5+minor.
<span class="gt">&nbsp;</span> <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>-2<span class="bt">&spades;</span>  = Extras, 5<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>s.
<span class="gt">&nbsp;</span> <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>-2NT<span class="gt"> </span>= Extras, 5<span class="ot">&diams;</span>s.
<span class="gt">&nbsp;</span> <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>-3<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>  = Extras, 6<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>s.
<span class="gt">&nbsp;</span> <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>-3<span class="ot">&diams;</span>  = Extras, 6<span class="ot">&diams;</span>s.
</pre>
If you grasp the scale above, the same pattern will re-appear in many similar sequences.
<p>
After the minimum-showing 2<span class="ot">&diams;</span> above and new relay:
<pre>
<span class="gt">&nbsp;</span>1<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>-1<span class="rt">&hearts;</span>-1<span class="bt">&spades;</span>-2<span class="ot">&diams;</span>-2<span class="rt">&hearts;</span>-2<span class="bt">&spades;</span>  = No 5-card minor.
<span class="gt">&nbsp;</span> <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>-2NT = 5<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>s.
<span class="gt">&nbsp;</span> <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>-3<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>  = 5<span class="ot">&diams;</span>s.
<span class="gt">&nbsp;</span> <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>-3<span class="ot">&diams;</span>  = 6<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>s.
<span class="gt">&nbsp;</span> <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>-3<span class="rt">&hearts;</span>  = 6<span class="ot">&diams;</span>s.
</pre>
After the 1NT response above establishing <span class="bt">&spades;</span> as trumps and new relay, we can use a similar model:
<pre>
<span class="gt">&nbsp;</span>1<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>-1<span class="rt">&hearts;</span>-1<span class="bt">&spades;</span>-1NT-2<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>-2<span class="ot">&diams;</span>  = Minimum. After new relay: No 5+minor, 5<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>s, 5<span class="ot">&diams;</span>s, etc.
<span class="gt">&nbsp;</span> <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>      <span class="gt"> </span>-2<span class="rt">&hearts;</span>  = Extras, no 5-card major.
<span class="gt">&nbsp;</span> <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>      <span class="gt"> </span>-2<span class="bt">&spades;</span>  = Extras, 5<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>s.
<span class="gt">&nbsp;</span> <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>      <span class="gt"> </span>-2NT = Extras, 5<span class="ot">&diams;</span>s.
<span class="gt">&nbsp;</span> <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>      <span class="gt"> </span>-3<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>  = Extras, 6<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>s.
<span class="gt">&nbsp;</span> <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>      <span class="gt"> </span>-2<span class="ot">&diams;</span>  = Extras, 6<span class="ot">&diams;</span>s.
</pre>
<h4>The 1<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>-1<span class="rt">&hearts;</span>-1NT relay<a id="1c1h1n" /></h4>
Without 4+<span class="bt">&spades;</span>s, opener here relays with 1NT.
<p>
Now, responder could still have 5<span class="bt">&spades;</span>s and opener 3-card support. So 1<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>-1<span class="rt">&hearts;</span>-1NT-2<span class="rt">&hearts;</span> is therefore reserved as a transfer bid showing 5<span class="bt">&spades;</span>s, while all other responses denies 5<span class="bt">&spades;</span>s and make a similar scale as above.
Thus we get:
<pre>
<span class="gt">&nbsp;</span>1<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>-1<span class="rt">&hearts;</span>-1NT-2<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>  = Minimum, denies 5<span class="bt">&spades;</span>s. After new relay: No 5+minor, 5<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>s, 5<span class="ot">&diams;</span>s, etc.
<span class="gt">&nbsp;</span> <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>    -2<span class="ot">&diams;</span>  = Extras, denies 5<span class="bt">&spades;</span>s, no 5+minor.
<span class="gt">&nbsp;</span> <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>    -2<span class="rt">&hearts;</span>  = 5-card <span class="bt">&spades;</span>-suit.
<span class="gt">&nbsp;</span> <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>    -2<span class="bt">&spades;</span>  = Extras, denies 5<span class="bt">&spades;</span>s, 5<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>s.
<span class="gt">&nbsp;</span> <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>    -2NT = Extras, denies 5<span class="bt">&spades;</span>s, 5<span class="ot">&diams;</span>s.
<span class="gt">&nbsp;</span> <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>    -3<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>  = Extras, denies 5<span class="bt">&spades;</span>s, 6<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>s.
<span class="gt">&nbsp;</span> <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>    -3<span class="ot">&diams;</span>  = Extras, denies 5<span class="bt">&spades;</span>s, 6<span class="ot">&diams;</span>s.
</pre>
When responder has shown a 5-card major, we essentially use the same scale, but since a 5-card minor is more rare here, the scale primarily distinguishes between 4-card minors or not:
<pre>
<span class="gt">&nbsp;</span>1<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>-1<span class="rt">&hearts;</span>-1NT-2<span class="rt">&hearts;</span>-2<span class="bt">&spades;</span>-2NT = Minimum. After new relay: No 4+minor, 4<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>s, 4<span class="ot">&diams;</span>s, etc.
<span class="gt">&nbsp;</span> <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>      <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>-3<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>  = Extras, no 4+minor.
<span class="gt">&nbsp;</span> <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>      <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>-3<span class="ot">&diams;</span>  = Extras, 4<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>s.
<span class="gt">&nbsp;</span> <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>      <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>-3<span class="rt">&hearts;</span>  = Extras, 4<span class="ot">&diams;</span>s.
<span class="gt">&nbsp;</span> <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>      <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>-3<span class="bt">&spades;</span>  = Extras, 5<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>s.
<span class="gt">&nbsp;</span> <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>      <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>-3NT = Extras, 5<span class="ot">&diams;</span>s.
</pre>
<h4>The 1<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>-1<span class="bt">&spades;</span> response<a id="1c1s" /></h4>
Responder here denies 4<span class="bt">&spades;</span>s, and promises 4 or 5 <span class="rt">&hearts;</span>s.
<p>
To preserve bidding space, opener relays with 1NT, regardless of whether he has <span class="rt">&hearts;</span>-support or not. Thus, an important feature here is that responder must <u>never</u> reply with 2<span class="rt">&hearts;</span>, since that could wrong-side the contract when opener has <span class="rt">&hearts;</span>-support.
<p>
Since opener might also hold 3<span class="rt">&hearts;</span>s, responder will use a transfer-bid here, too, to show 5-card <span class="rt">&hearts;</span>s.
<p>
Therefore, the scale looks like this:
<pre>
<span class="gt">&nbsp;</span>1<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>-1<span class="bt">&spades;</span>-1NT-2<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>  = Minimum, denies 5<span class="rt">&hearts;</span>s. After a new 2<span class="ot">&diams;</span> <u>or</u> 2<span class="rt">&hearts;</span> relay: No 5+minor, 5<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>s, 5<span class="ot">&diams;</span>s, etc.
<span class="gt">&nbsp;</span> <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>    -2<span class="ot">&diams;</span>  = 5-card <span class="rt">&hearts;</span>-suit.
<span class="gt">&nbsp;</span> <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>    <span class="red">-2<span class="rt">&hearts;</span>  = <i>NOTE: "Forbidden bid" since opener might have <span class="rt">&hearts;</span>-support!</i></span>
<span class="gt">&nbsp;</span> <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>    -2<span class="bt">&spades;</span>  = Extras, denies 5<span class="rt">&hearts;</span>s, 5<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>s.
<span class="gt">&nbsp;</span> <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>    -2NT = Extras, denies 5<span class="rt">&hearts;</span>s, 5<span class="ot">&diams;</span>s.
<span class="gt">&nbsp;</span> <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>    -3<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>  = Extras, denies 5<span class="rt">&hearts;</span>s, 6<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>s.
<span class="gt">&nbsp;</span> <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>    -3<span class="ot">&diams;</span>  = Extras, denies 5<span class="rt">&hearts;</span>s, 6<span class="ot">&diams;</span>s.
</pre>
As indicated after 1<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>-1<span class="bt">&spades;</span>-1NT-2<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>, opener may here chose to relay with <u>either</u> 2<span class="ot">&diams;</span> or 2<span class="rt">&hearts;</span>.
<p>
Holding 4<span class="rt">&hearts;</span>s himself, he now right-sides the likely <span class="rt">&hearts;</span>-contract by relaying with 2<span class="rt">&hearts;</span>.
Lacking 4<span class="rt">&hearts;</span>s, he rather maximize the bidding-space by relaying with 2<span class="ot">&diams;</span>, and responder's scale can now start with 2<span class="rt">&hearts;</span> since <span class="rt">&hearts;</span>-trump is normally out of the picture.
<p>
In both cases, the continued scale is the same: No 5+minor, 5<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>s, 5<span class="ot">&diams;</span>s, etc.
<p>
After responder shows a 5-card <span class="rt">&hearts;</span>-suit, the scale, of course, is the same as with 5-card <span class="bt">&spades;</span>-suit above, primarily distinguishing between 4-card minors or not.
<h4>1<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>-1M-...; continuations<a id="1c1s" /></h4>
As soon as opener has the information he needs to set a 3NT or 4M game-contract, and cannot see slam-chances after responder shows minimum, he of course jumps to the final contract.
<p>
After the sequences where responder denies 5-card minor, the next relay asks for a 4-card minor, which he bids naturally.
If responder has nothing particular to show, he can generally "default" to the cheapest major-bid (he has already denied the suit, or denied extra-length in it).
<p>
Otherwise, after responder has ran the scales above to the end, for simplicity, one can continue bidding naturally and/or according to normal principles in a standard system.
<p>
If the trump-suit has not yet been clearly set, opener can do so at the 3-level. Or bid a natural bid. Or cue-bid/slamtry at the 4-level. Etc.
<h4>Opener breaks the relay<a id="1c1s" /></h4>
Sometimes, when opener has a long suit, he might wish to break the relay-sequences at the 2- or 3-level, to show a suit naturally.
<p>
However, if he does so <u>immediately</u> after 1<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>-1M, and bids a new suit at the 2-level, these sequences are reserved for showing <u>voids</u>.
Opener then bids 2-level "transfers" to his void-suit (1<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>-1M-2<span class="bt">&spades;</span> showing a <span class="gt">&clubs;</span>-void). 
<p>
Responder can then bid 2NT with strong stoppers (e.g. KQTx or better) in the void-suit, or bid a 5-card suit naturally (outside the void), and otherwise responds by relaying in the void-suit and let opener continue naturally.
<h4>The 1<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>-2<span class="gt">&clubs;</span> response<a id="1c2c" /></h4>
While 1<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>-1NT and 1<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>-2NT cover responder-hands with a 6-card major, 1<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>-2<span class="gt">&clubs;</span> shows both majors with 4 or 5 cards in each suit -- i.e 4-4/4-5/5-4/5-5.
<h4>The 1<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>-2<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>-2M relays<a id="1c2c2d" /></h4>
If opener has 4-card support in either major, he can immediately set the trump-suit at the 2-level by bidding the suit.
<p>
The relay-scales are similar as after 1<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>-1M, but since responder now has already shown 2 suits, it seems more efficient to show any shortness in a minor than length.
Thus, when opener sets <span class="rt">&hearts;</span>s as trumps, the scale looks like (sgtn=singleton):
<pre>
<span class="gt">&nbsp;</span>1<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>-2<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>-2<span class="rt">&hearts;</span>-2<span class="bt">&spades;</span>  = Minimum. After new relay: No sgtn, sgtn-<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>, sgtn-<span class="ot">&diams;</span>, void-<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>, void-<span class="ot">&diams;</span>.
<span class="gt">&nbsp;</span> <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>-2NT = Extras, no sgtn.
<span class="gt">&nbsp;</span> <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>-3<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>  = Extras, sgtn-<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>.
<span class="gt">&nbsp;</span> <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>-3<span class="ot">&diams;</span>  = Extras, sgtn-<span class="ot">&diams;</span>.
<span class="gt">&nbsp;</span> <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>-3<span class="rt">&hearts;</span>  = Extras, void-<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>.
<span class="gt">&nbsp;</span> <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>-3<span class="bt">&spades;</span>  = Extras, void-<span class="ot">&diams;</span>.
</pre>
If opener sets <span class="bt">&spades;</span>s as trumps with 1<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>-2<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>-2<span class="bt">&spades;</span>, responses are the same, only shifted one level higher.
<h4>The 1<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>-2<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>-2<span class="ot">&diams;</span> relay<a id="1c2c2d" /></h4>
When opener lacks a 4-card major, and cannot set the trump-suit immediately, he may relay with 2<span class="ot">&diams;</span>, and responder bids "exclusion" to avoid wrong-siding the contract -- i.e by-passes his 5-card major(s):
<pre>
<span class="gt">&nbsp;</span>1<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>-2<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>-2<span class="ot">&diams;</span>-2<span class="rt">&hearts;</span>  = Exactly 4<span class="rt">&hearts;</span>s, 4 or 5 <span class="bt">&spades;</span>s.
<span class="gt">&nbsp;</span> <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>-2<span class="bt">&spades;</span>  = Exactly 5<span class="rt">&hearts;</span>s, exactly 4<span class="bt">&spades;</span>s.
<span class="gt">&nbsp;</span> <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>-2NT = 5-5 majors. Minimum. After new relay: sgtn-<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>, sgtn-<span class="ot">&diams;</span>, void-<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>, void-<span class="ot">&diams;</span>.
<span class="gt">&nbsp;</span> <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>-3<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>  = 5-5 majors. Extras, sgtn-<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>.
<span class="gt">&nbsp;</span> <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>-3<span class="ot">&diams;</span>  = 5-5 majors. Extras, sgtn-<span class="ot">&diams;</span>.
<span class="gt">&nbsp;</span> <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>-3<span class="rt">&hearts;</span>  = 5-5 majors. Extras, void-<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>.
<span class="gt">&nbsp;</span> <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>-3<span class="bt">&spades;</span>  = 5-5 majors. Extras, void-<span class="ot">&diams;</span>.
</pre>
After the 2<span class="rt">&hearts;</span> response above, with 3<span class="bt">&spades;</span>s opener may bid 2<span class="bt">&spades;</span> to probe for a 5-3 fit, after which:
<pre>
<span class="gt">&nbsp;</span>1<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>-2<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>-2<span class="ot">&diams;</span>-2<span class="rt">&hearts;</span>-2<span class="bt">&spades;</span>-2NT = 5-card <span class="bt">&spades;</span>-suit. Establishes <span class="bt">&spades;</span>s as trump.
<span class="gt">&nbsp;</span> <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>-3<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>  = 4<span class="bt">&spades;</span>s. Minimum. After new relay: No sgtn, sgtn-<span class="gt">&clubs;</span>, sgtn-<span class="ot">&diams;</span>.
<span class="gt">&nbsp;</span> <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>  <span class="gt"> </span>-3<span class="ot">&diams;</span>  = 4<span class="bt">&spades;</span>s. Extras, no sgtn.
