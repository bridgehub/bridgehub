<h4>Background<a id="bg" /></h4>
In Precision Club, 1!C-1M is a natural GF with 5+major, while 1!C-1NT is a balanced GF. 
<p>
The immediate and obvious downside of this natural scheme is that the final game/slam-contract very often gets "wrong-sided", i.e. declared by the weaker hand.
<p>
Later approaches to remedy this weakness has been, for example in Carrot-Club, to define 1!C-1!H as GF without 5+major, while 1!S shows 5!Hs and 1NT shows 5!Ss
(another possibility is: 1!C-1!H=5!S, 1!C-1!S=bal, 1!C-1NT=5!H).
<p>
This is an improvement, since it will wrong-side the final contract less often.
But after 1!C-1!H, for example, it is not unlikely that the final contract will still turn out to be hearts, particularly since responder may well have 4!Hs.
And after 1!C-1NT, unless opener has spade support, the final contract is often a wrong-sided 3NT.
<p>
So can we do better than that?
<p>
<h4>Introduction<a id="intro" /></h4>
<p>
Last summer, at the annual Ã–rebro Bridge Festival in Sweden, I met with an old friend and bridge-partner from the 1980's, math professor Bengt Alrud from Gothenburg, Sweden, and got an introduction to his latest bidding-system, named "Turbo".
<p>
His full system is very innovative, ground-breaking, and -- frankly -- amazing.
But, admittedly, including a lot of complex relay-sequences not super-easy to memorize.
Therefore, I made a simplified version ("Mini-Turbo"), that I have played with other partners, and which includes the scheme presented here.
<p>
One of the areas I really like, and that many other players could quite easily pick up, is the GF-responses to a strong-1!C opening.
<p>
They are particularly designed to minimize the risk of wrong-siding the contract.
And besides placing the 1!C opener as declarer, the second important goal is also -- through relay-methods -- that declarer should disclose as little information of his hand as possible to defenders.
<p>
While we can, of course, never completely guarantee right-siding of the final contract, I think you will agree that the approach presented here increases the probability significantly.
<p>
Personally, I consider this a clearly superior method to any other such system I have seen, and an obvious study for any serious pair playing a strong-1!C system.
<p>
Re. the relay-sequences, I am here employing a simple -- yet, very playable -- version, in order not to overshadow the basic concepts with complexities for now.
They follow a common pattern, designed to be easy to grasp and memorize, and at the same time work as a solid foundation to get you started using the methods in practical play.
<p>
As players gain experience and get more familiar with these methods, they can certainly be further developed and enhanced to fully optimize the available information-space.
<p>
<h4>System<a id="system" /></h4>
<p>
We open a strong-1!C on all hands with 16+hcp, and a GF-responder is ca 9+hcp or a good 8 hcp.
A sound principle for subsequent slam-bidding is also that a GF-response promises minimum 2 controls (c) -- where Ace=2c, King=1c -- otherwise start a negative 1!C-1!D, even if you decide to later drive on to game.
<p>
If you prefer 1!C as 17+, you can of course adjust the minimum of responses.
<p>
Generally, a GF-responder to 1!C will show, in turn:
<p>
&nbsp;a) His relevant lengths in the majors, so opener can assess whether we have a common major trump-suit or not.
<p>
&nbsp;b) Whether he is <b>minimum (ca 8-11 bad hcp)</b> or has <b>extras (11 good hcp and up)</b>. When responder shows a minimum hand, opener can often set the game-contract immediately, to avoid spilling more information to defenders.
<p>
&nbsp;c) Only if opener still needs to know: More details about lengths/shortnesses in other suits, etc.
<p>
Here's the first round responses. As you can see, a GF-responder's first focus is on the majors only:
<p>
 1!C-1!D  = 0-7(8) hcp, or less than 2c.

 1!C-1!H  = GF. Denies 4!Hs. May or may not have !S-suit, i.e 0-5!Ss. 
                Includes both balanced and unbalanced hands.

 1!C-1!S  = GF. 4-5!Hs. Denies 4!Ss. Both balanced and unbalanced hands, 
                and may also have a longer minor side-suit.

 1!C-1NT = GF. A 6-card major. Denies 4 in the other major.

 1!C-2!C  = GF. At least 4-4 in the majors, but no 6-card major -- i.e 4-4/4-5/5-4/5-5 in majors.

 1!C-2!D  = Weak, ca 0-4 hcp. 6+!Hs.

 1!C-2!H  = Weak, ca 0-4 hcp. 6+!Ss.

 1!C-2!S  = GF. At least 5-5 in minors.

 1!C-2NT = GF. 6-4 or 4-6 in the majors.

 1!C-3X  = GF transfers, showing 7+cards headed by KQ or better (1!C-3!S shows 7+!Cs).
<p>
I will not cover here any 1!C-1!D continuations. Any strong-1!C scheme where 1!C-1!D is negative 0+hcp will work.
<p>
<h4>The 1!C-1!H response<a id="1c1h" /></h4>
This is the most frequent response with GF hands.
Responder denies 4!Hs, and could have anything from 0 to 5 !Ss.
<p>
This response is used for all such hands, whether balanced or unbalanced.
<p>
Opener now has 2 relays:<br />
&nbsp;<span class='mono'>1!C-1!H-1NT</span> denying 4!Ss, while<br />
&nbsp;<span class='mono'>1!C-1!H-1!S</span>  shows 4+!Ss.<br />
Both relays can be either balanced or unbalanced -- only the spade-length matters -- and with 4+!Ss opener may also have another longer suit.
<p>
<h4>The 1!C-1!H-1!S relay<a id="1c1h1s" /></h4>
After 1!C-1!H-1!S (in line with the principles above) responder's priorities is to tell:
<p>
&nbsp;a) Whether he has 4+!S support, exactly 3!Ss, or shorter !S-suit. 
<p>
&nbsp;b) Whether he has minimum or extra values.
<p>
&nbsp;c) (If needed) Whether he has a 5-card (or 6-card) minor.
<p>
The responses:
<p>
 1!C-1!H-1!S-1NT = 4+!Ss (sets !Ss as trumps).
         -2!C  = Exactly 3!Ss.
<span class="txt">Higher bids all show 2 or fewer !Ss:</span>
<p>
 1!C-1!H-1!S-2!D  = Minimum hand, ca 8-11 bad hcp.
         -2!H  = Extras (ca 11 good hcp and up). Denies 5+minor.
         -2!S  = Extras, 5!Cs.
         -2NT = Extras, 5!Ds.
         -3!C  = Extras, 6!Cs.
         -3!D  = Extras, 6!Ds.
<p>
If you grasp the scale above, the same pattern will re-appear in many similar sequences.
<p>
After the minimum-showing 2!D above and new relay:
<p>
 1!C-1!H-1!S-2!D-2!H-2!S  = No 5-card minor.
               -2NT = 5!Cs.
               -3!C  = 5!Ds.
               -3!D  = 6!Cs.
               -3!H  = 6!Ds.
<p>
After the 1NT response above establishing !S as trumps and new relay, we can use a similar model:
<p>
 1!C-1!H-1!S-1NT-2!C-2!D  = Minimum. After new relay: No 5+minor, 5!Cs, 5!Ds, etc.
                -2!H  = Extras, no 5-card major.
                -2!S  = Extras, 5!Cs.
                -2NT = Extras, 5!Ds.
                -3!C  = Extras, 6!Cs.
                -2!D  = Extras, 6!Ds.
<p>
<h4>The 1!C-1!H-1NT relay<a id="1c1h1n" /></h4>
Without 4+!Ss, opener here relays with 1NT.
<p>
Now, responder could still have 5!Ss and opener 3-card support. So 1!C-1!H-1NT-2!H is therefore reserved as a transfer bid showing 5!Ss, while all other responses denies 5!Ss and make a similar scale as above.
Thus we get:
<p>
 1!C-1!H-1NT-2!C  = Minimum, denies 5!Ss. After new relay: No 5+minor, 5!Cs, 5!Ds, etc.
          -2!D  = Extras, denies 5!Ss, no 5+minor.
          -2!H  = 5-card !S-suit.
          -2!S  = Extras, denies 5!Ss, 5!Cs.
          -2NT = Extras, denies 5!Ss, 5!Ds.
          -3!C  = Extras, denies 5!Ss, 6!Cs.
          -3!D  = Extras, denies 5!Ss, 6!Ds.

When responder has shown a 5-card major, we essentially use the same scale, but since a 5-card minor is more rare here, the scale primarily distinguishes between 4-card minors or not:
<p>
 1!C-1!H-1NT-2!H-2!S-2NT = Minimum. After new relay: No 4+minor, 4!Cs, 4!Ds, etc.
                -3!C  = Extras, no 4+minor.
                -3!D  = Extras, 4!Cs.
                -3!H  = Extras, 4!Ds.
                -3!S  = Extras, 5!Cs.
                -3NT = Extras, 5!Ds.
<p>
<h4>The 1!C-1!S response<a id="1c1s" /></h4>
Responder here denies 4!Ss, and promises 4 or 5 !Hs.
<p>
To preserve bidding space, opener relays with 1NT, regardless of whether he has !H-support or not. Thus, an important feature here is that responder must <u>never</u> reply with 2!H, since that could wrong-side the contract when opener has !H-support.
<p>
Since opener might also hold 3!Hs, responder will use a transfer-bid here, too, to show 5-card !Hs.
<p>
Therefore, the scale looks like this:
<p>
 1!C-1!S-1NT-2!C  = Minimum, denies 5!Hs. After a new 2!D <u>or</u> 2!H relay: No 5+minor, 5!Cs, 5!Ds, etc.
          -2!D  = 5-card !H-suit.
<span class="mono red">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-2!H&nbsp;&nbsp;= <i>NOTE: "Forbidden bid" since opener might have !H-support!</i></span><br />
          -2!S  = Extras, denies 5!Hs, 5!Cs.
          -2NT = Extras, denies 5!Hs, 5!Ds.
          -3!C  = Extras, denies 5!Hs, 6!Cs.
          -3!D  = Extras, denies 5!Hs, 6!Ds.
<p>
As indicated after 1!C-1!S-1NT-2!C, opener may here chose to relay with <u>either</u> 2!D or 2!H.
<p>
Holding 4!Hs himself, he now right-sides the likely !H-contract by relaying with 2!H.
Lacking 4!Hs, he rather maximize the bidding-space by relaying with 2!D, and responder's scale can now start with 2!H since !H-trump is normally out of the picture.
<p>
In both cases, the continued scale is the same: No 5+minor, 5!Cs, 5!Ds, etc.
<p>
After responder shows a 5-card !H-suit, the scale, of course, is the same as with 5-card !S-suit above, primarily distinguishing between 4-card minors or not.
<h4>1!C-1M continuations<a id="1c1m" /></h4>
As soon as opener has the information he needs to set a 3NT or 4M game-contract, and cannot see slam-chances after responder shows minimum, he of course jumps to the final contract.
<p>
After the sequences where responder denies 5-card minor, the next relay asks for a 4-card minor, which he bids naturally.
If responder has nothing particular to show, he can generally "default" to the cheapest major-bid (he has already denied the suit, or denied extra-length in it).
<p>
Otherwise, after responder has ran the scales above to the end, for simplicity, one can continue bidding naturally and/or according to normal principles in a standard system.
<p>
If the trump-suit has not yet been clearly set, opener can do so at the 3-level. Or bid a natural bid. Or cue-bid/slamtry at the 4-level. Etc.
<h4>Opener breaks the relay<a id="breakrelay" /></h4>
Sometimes, when opener has a long suit, he might wish to break the relay-sequences at the 2- or 3-level, to show a suit naturally.
<p>
However, if he does so <u>immediately</u> after 1!C-1M, and bids a new suit at the 2-level, these sequences are reserved for showing <u>voids</u>.
Opener then bids 2-level "transfers" to his void-suit (1!C-1M-2!S showing a !C-void). 
<p>
Responder can then bid 2NT with strong stoppers (e.g. KQTx or better) in the void-suit, or bid a 5-card suit naturally (outside the void), and otherwise responds by relaying in the void-suit and let opener continue naturally.
<h4>The 1!C-2!C response<a id="1c2c" /></h4>
While 1!C-1NT and 1!C-2NT cover responder-hands with a 6-card major, 1!C-2!C shows GF hands with both majors and 4 or 5 cards in each suit -- i.e 4-4/4-5/5-4/5-5.
<h4>The 1!C-2!C-2M relays<a id="1c2c2m" /></h4>
If opener has 4-card support in either major, he can immediately set the trump-suit at the 2-level by bidding the suit.
<p>
The relay-scales are similar as after 1!C-1M, but since responder now has already shown 2 suits, it seems more efficient to show any shortness in a minor than length.
Thus, when opener sets !Hs as trumps, the scale looks like (sgtn=singleton):
<p>
 1!C-2!C-2!H-2!S  = Minimum. After new relay: No sgtn, sgtn-!C, sgtn-!D, void-!C, void-!D.
         -2NT = Extras, no sgtn.
         -3!C  = Extras, sgtn-!C.
         -3!D  = Extras, sgtn-!D.
         -3!H  = Extras, void-!C.
         -3!S  = Extras, void-!D.
<p>
If opener sets !Ss as trumps with 1!C-2!C-2!S, responses are the same, only shifted one level higher.
<h4>The 1!C-2!C-2!D relay<a id="1c2c2d" /></h4>
When opener lacks a 4-card major, and cannot set the trump-suit immediately, he may relay with 2!D, and responder bids "exclusion" to avoid wrong-siding the contract -- i.e by-passes his 5-card major(s):
<p>
 1!C-2!C-2!D-2!H  = Exactly 4!Hs, 4 or 5 !Ss.
         -2!S  = Exactly 5!Hs, exactly 4!Ss.
         -2NT = 5-5 majors. Minimum. After new relay: sgtn-!C, sgtn-!D, void-!C, void-!D.
         -3!C  = 5-5 majors. Extras, sgtn-!C.
         -3!D  = 5-5 majors. Extras, sgtn-!D.
         -3!H  = 5-5 majors. Extras, void-!C.
         -3!S  = 5-5 majors. Extras, void-!D.
<p>
After the 2!H response above, with 3!Ss opener may bid 2!S to probe for a 5-3 fit, after which:
<p>
 1!C-2!C-2!D-2!H-2!S-2NT = 5-card !S-suit. Establishes !Ss as trump.
               -3!C  = 4!Ss. Minimum. After new relay: No sgtn, sgtn-!C, sgtn-!D.
               -3!D  = 4!Ss. Extras, no sgtn.
               -3!H  = 4!Ss. Extras, sgtn-!C.
               -3!S  = 4!Ss. Extras, sgtn-!D.
<p>
<h4>The 1!C-1NT response<a id="1c1n" /></h4>
<p>
1!C-1NT is GF with a 6-card major, <b>and denies</b> 4 in the other major.
<p>
Holding a GF hand and a 7-card major headed by KQ or better, responder starts with a double-jump transfer bid, 1!C-3!D/3!H.
But a 7-card major of poorer quality will also respond 1!C-1NT, so in reality it shows a 6+major.
<p>
Opener usually relays with 2!C to asks for the major, and responder uses a similar scale as above:
 
 1!C-1NT-2!C-2!D  = 6+!Hs, minimum. After new relay: No 4-card minor, 4!Cs, 4!Ds, 5!Cs, 5!Ds.
          -2!H  = 6+!Ss, minimum. After new relay: No 4-card minor, 4!Cs, 4!Ds, 5!Cs, 5!Ds.
          -2!S  = 6+!Hs, extras.  After new relay: No 4-card minor, 4!Cs, 4!Ds, 5!Cs, 5!Ds.
          -2NT = 6+!Ss, extras, no 4-card minor.
          -3!C  = 6+!Ss, extras, 4!Cs.
          -3!D  = 6+!Ss, extras, 4!Ds.
          -3!H  = 6+!Ss, extras, 5!Cs.
          -3!S  = 6+!Ss, extras, 5!Ds.
<p>
<h4>The 1!C-2NT response<a id="1c2n" /></h4>
<p>
1!C-2NT is GF with a 6-card major <b>and also</b> 4 cards in the other major.
<p>
If opener has a 4+major of his own, he can set the trump-suit with a natural 3!H/3!S.
Otherwise, he usually relays with 3!C:
 
 1!C-2NT-3!C-3!D  = 6+!Hs, minimum.
          -3!H  = 6+!Ss, minimum.
          -3!S  = 6+!Hs, extras.
          -3NT = 6+!Ss, extras, but non-forcing (if opener has short spades).
          -4!C = 6+!Ss, extras, and forcing.
